This project involved the NVE molecular dynamics simulation for argon gas. It is a common first molecule due it's simplistic lack of intermolecular interactions. The code here is heavily inspired and at times borrowed from both the book "Computer Simulation of Liquids" by M.P. Allen and D.J. Tildesley as well as online code from the Univeristy of Buffalo's physic department. The University's code can be found at the following url: http://www.physics.buffalo.edu/phy411-506/topic1/topic1-lec2.pdf.
