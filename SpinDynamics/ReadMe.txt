This project simulations a one-dimensional spin dynamics simulation. The project conerns itself with determing the time correlations of each spin vector. The main C++ file carries out the actual simulations of the spins. The Python script then performs the time correlations on all of the spin vectors outputted by the simulation file. The matlab file then carries out fourier transformations and plotting duties.
